# Mattèo's website
Hello everyone, here is the repository of my personnal website, it is powered by vue.js through the nuxt.js framework, markdownit, front-matter, obviously VueJ and the powerfull Bulma Framework. This project is in beta so it probably contains bugs and some mistakes.

If you wan't to contribute to the development of the project it is possible and encouraged 😄 (I'm a novice developer that's why my apps may have an ugly code style). Feel free to publish issue it's so helpful 😇

## TODO's
