# MattÃ¨o's website
Hello everyone, here is the repository of my personnal website, it is powered by vue.js through the nuxt.js framework, remark, this project is in beta so it probably contains bugs and some mistakes.

If you wan't to contribute to the development of the project it is possible and encouraged ðŸ˜„ (I'm a novice developer that's why my apps may have an ugly code style). Feel free to publish issue it's so helpful ðŸ˜‡
